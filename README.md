# VR-Production
Consists of components of several VR porjects I made using javascript and field in a VR production course. The capsone project combined three of my passions in computer-generated music, colorful and algorithmic 3D art, and electrical muscle stimulation to make a visualizer in VR in which touching the virtual "knobs" would elicit electrical shocks to the arms. This mulitsensory experience allows users to experience the digital facilitation of visual, auditory, and tactile senses simultaneously in a non-conventional manner.
